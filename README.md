Cryptospora
=====================================

>A 2nd year computer science project at Cardiff University.

*Cryptospora is a decentralized messaging system that gives users the choice of AES encrypted messaging or steganography.*

Please Note
-
This project was developed for a university project, the project deadline has come and gone. However if anyone is
interested in continuing development It would be great to hear from you. It is currently somewhat functional but not in a state
to release, the pod is hardcoded so it will only work on our testing pod. I will try get it up to a version
where it can be packaged and used on any system. - Henry
